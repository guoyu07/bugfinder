<p>One of the great new features of our framework is the ability to perform upgrades via the Admin Dashboard, where update packages are listed, modified files can be seen, and upgrades can be performed at the click of a button.</p> <p>Unfortunately not everyone will get to experience how great this can…</p></blockquote>

This is a maintenance release that focuses on bug fixes and improvements.</p><p>v3.0.1 is available as a full download package, a manual v3.0 to v3.0.1 upgrade package, and as an automatic upgrade through CoreUpdate.</p><p>Existing v3.0 users can upgrade to v3.0.1 through CoreUpdate via the Admin Dashboard -> Applications -> Tools -> Core Update application. The update package may take up to 6 hours to become available.</p><p>Please note that under certain server environments CoreUpdate will report a successful upgrade when no files have in fact been updated. This can be confirmed if after the upgrade CoreUpdate still shows v3.0.1 is available to upgrade to. This is due to incorrectly detecting certain file permissions and has been fixed in v3.0.1. We apologize if this affects you and direct you to the manual v3.0 to v3.0.1 upgrade package that can be extracted and copied over to your installation.</p><p>We've taken this opportunity and have greatly improved CoreUpdate to now perform non-destructive updates. If any type of error is encountered during an upgrade procedure, CoreUpdate automatically reverts the changes it has performed and returns to the original state.</p><p>The download packages for v3.0.1 are available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/solutions/downloads">http://www.oscommerce.com/solutions/downloads</a></p><p>The releases notes for v3.0.1 is available at:</p><p><a href="http://www.oscommerce.info/confluence/x/C4BH">http://www.oscommerce.info/confluence/x/C4BH</a></p><p>We look forward to pushing out v3.0.2 soon with new Applications and user features!</p>";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,137";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Fri, 08 Apr 2011 18:39:58 -0400";}i:2;a:5:{s:5:"title";s:22:"osCommerce and the CLA";s:4:"link";s:43:"http://blogs.oscommerce.com/post/4376910846";s:11:"description";s:579:"<a href="http://www.freelancephp.co.uk/2011/04/05/oscommerce-and-the-cla/">osCommerce and the CLA</a>: <p>Published by Mark Evans</p>

<p>To follow-up to my previous posting about osCommerce and the BSD Licence I will now try and answer some of the misconceptions around the new CLA (Contributor License Agreement) which was added as part of the osCommerce 3.x release.

This conquers our largest milestone yet of building a new framework to base our future goals and releases on.</p><p>This is our first release that abstracts user features from the core framework to allow customizations to be easily applied, to improve existing and introduce new core framework API features, and by installing and managing Add-Ons for exciting new user features in a flexible and modular manner.</p><p>This abstraction no longer limits us to just providing only a shop frontend and a shop backend, but now introduces the opportunity to build entire websites with the framework. Our focus remains on e-commerce and cannot wait to see what the community builds in addition.</p><p>osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 is optimized for and requires PHP 5.3+, supports real database abstraction to support native database server features such as stored procedures, contains a separate namespace to override and perform customizations in, and can easily and securely be upgraded via signed Phar update packages.</p><p>Our focus on this release is to stabilize and freeze the framework API and to start building on user features with the community. It does not contain a complete base feature set to start running an online shop on. We are continuing to work hard on completing the base feature set and will push out each completed feature as an update package during April.</p><p>osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 is now completely released under the BSD license to help drive innovation in the open and commercial markets.</p><p>We welcome you to explore the new possibilities of osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0 and to participate in its development to help and improve the core framework and introduce exciting new user features.
